# This is sboui's blacklist file. It operates only on the names of installed
# packages, not any SlackBuild name in the repo. That means that any package
# listed here can be installed, but they cannot be removed, upgraded, or
# reinstalled.
 
# Example blacklisting packages by name:
#avl
#vlc
#i3
 
# You can blacklist using regular expressions
#
# You don't need to use the full regex here, because all of the following
# will be checked for the regex: name, version, arch, build, and full package
# name.
#
# This one will blacklist all Alien Bob packages
#[0-9]+alien
#
# This one would blacklist anything with "flash" in the name
#(.*)flash(.*)
