.SH NAME
sboui \- ncurses user interface for SlackBuilds.org package managers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sboui
[\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-file\fR \fIFILE\fR] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sboui
is an ncurses-based user interface for
.BR sbopkg ,
.BR sbotools ,
and similar tools to build and install software from SlackBuild scripts hosted at SlackBuilds.org (SBo).
Unlike many Slackware system administration tools with 
.BR dialog -based
user interfaces,
.B sboui
is written in C++ utilizing low-level ncurses library calls.
This approach allows much greater flexibility in the design of the user interface and also makes it very fast.
The main features of
.B sboui
include:
.IP \(bu
Two-pane browsable listing of software groups and names
.IP \(bu
Filters: all, installed, upgradable, tagged, blacklisted, and non-dependencies
.IP \(bu
Search the repository, including searching in READMEs
.IP \(bu
Dependency resolution: forward and inverse mode
.IP \(bu
View and edit files in the repository
.IP \(bu
Tag multiple packages (or groups) to apply batch changes
.IP \(bu
Blacklist installed packages by name or regex pattern
.IP \(bu
Comes with several built-in color themes and supports custom themes
.IP \(bu
Designed for and tested to work flawlessly with
.B sbopkg
and 
.BR sbotools ,
but it is easy to set it up to work with your own custom package manager
.IP \(bu
Includes a built-in package manager,
.BR sboui-backend ,
that can be used instead of
.B sbopkg
or
.BR sbotools .
.PP
.B Instructions
.PP
If the built-in package manager is not going to be used, a package manager such as
.BR sbopkg ,
.BR sbotools ,
or a custom tool must be installed.
.B sboui
also requires a configuration file,
.I /etc/sboui/sboui.conf
(the system-wide default) or
.I ~/.sboui.conf
(per-user override of the system-wide default).
The initial install will provide the former, while upgrades will add
.I /etc/sboui/sboui.conf.new
that the user can choose to merge with or replace the original.
See
.BR sboui.conf (5)
for more information about the configuration file.
Note also that all options can be changed at runtime in the options dialog window, and doing so will overwrite
.IR ~/.sboui.conf .
.PP
.B sboui
is a keyboard-driven program.
To switch the active pane, use the
.I Tab
key or the
.I Right
and
.I Left
arrow keys.
Use the
.I Up
and
.I Down
arrow keys,
.IR Home ,
.IR End ,
.IR PgUp ,
and 
.I PgDn
to navigate lists and dialog boxes.
When the right (or bottom, if using the vertical layout) list is active, press
.I Enter
to display possible actions for the highlighted software package.
The
.I q 
key quits the program.
The 
.I ?
key displays the full list of keyboard shortcuts.
.SH OPTIONS
Command-line options for
.B sboui
are as follows:
.TP
.BR \-f ", " \-\-file " " \fIFILE\fR

.TP
.BR \-\-version

.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status is 0 if the command line options are valid and the configuration file was successfully read.
If invalid command line options are specified, the configuration file could not be read, or the configuration file contains errors, the exit status is 1.
Other errors that can occur during execution (e.g., a build failure for a package) are indicated to the user but do not affect the exit status.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B PAGER
.br
Application used to view READMEs.
.B less
is used as the default if this environment variable is not set.

.BR sboui.conf (5)
for more information about the entries in this file.

Note: this file is overwritten when settings are changed in the Options window of the user interface.
.TP
.I /etc/sboui/package_blacklist
.br
File used to blacklist installed packages.
Installed packages are searched for matches in the app name, version, arch, build, and complete package name against all patterns listed in this file.
Regex patterns are allowed.
.IP
The package_blacklist is used to prevent software from being upgraded, reinstalled, or removed, but not from being installed in the first place. 
These three actions will not be available for blacklisted packages.
They will also be excluded from the ``upgradable`` filter and included in the ``blacklisted`` filter.
.TP
.I /etc/sboui/sboui-backend.conf
.br
Configuration file for the built-in package manager,
.BR sboui-backend .
See
.BR sboui-backend (8)
and
.BR sboui-backend.conf (5)
for more information.
.TP
Color theme files
.br
Files defining colors for different UI elements.
System color themes are stored in
.IR /usr/share/sboui/themes .
Users can also add their own color themes in
.IR $HOME/.local/share/sboui/themes.
If not present, default color settings will be used.
See
.BR sboui.conf (5)
for more information about changing color settings.
.TP
Build options files
.br
Files containing build options for SlackBuilds.
There is one file per SlackBuild, with the naming convention {SlackBuild name}.buildopts.
They are stored in
.IR /var/lib/sboui/buildopts .
.IP
These files are automatically created by
.B sboui
when build options are set through the user interface and
.B save_buildopts
is enabled, but they can also be created manually if desired.
