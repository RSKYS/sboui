.TH SBOUI 8
.SH NAME
sboui \- ncurses user interface for SBo package managers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sboui
[\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-file\fR \fIFILE\fR] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B sboui
is an ncurses-based user interface for
.BR sbopkg ,
.BR sbotools ,
and similar tools to build and install software from SlackBuild scripts hosted at SlackBuilds.org (SBo).
Unlike many Slackware system administration tools with 
.BR dialog -based
user interfaces,
.B sboui
is written in C++ utilizing low-level ncurses library calls.
This approach allows much greater flexibility in the design of the user interface and also makes it very fast.
The main features of
.B sboui
include:
.IP \(bu
A two-pane listing of software groups and names
.IP \(bu
Filters: all, installed, upgradable, tagged, and non-dependencies
.IP \(bu
Searching the local repository
.IP \(bu
Forward and inverse dependency resolution
.IP \(bu
Viewing and editing files in the local repository
.IP \(bu
Tagging multiple packages (or groups) to apply batch changes
.IP \(bu
Support for any custom SBo package manager meeting certain conditions described in \fBsboui.conf\fR(5)
.IP \(bu
Configurable colors

.B Instructions
.PP
Before running
.BR sboui ,
an SBo packager must first be installed.
It can be
.BR sbopkg ,
.BR sbotools ,
or a custom tool.
.B sboui
also requires a configuration file,
.IR /etc/sboui/sboui.conf .
The initial install will provide a default version of this file, while upgrades will add
.I /etc/sboui/sboui.conf.new
that the user can choose to merge with or replace the original.
See
.BR sboui.conf (5)
for more information about the configuration file.
Note also that most options can be changed at runtime in the options dialog window.
.PP
.B sboui
is a keyboard-driven program.
To switch the active pane, use the
.I Tab
key or the
.I Right
and
.I Left
arrow keys.
Use the
.I Up
and
.I Down
arrow keys,
.IR Home ,
.IR End ,
.IR PgUp ,
and 
.I PgDn
to navigate lists and dialog boxes.
When the right (or bottom, if using the vertical layout) list is active, press
.I Enter
to display possible actions for the highlighted software package.
The
.I q 
key quits the program.
The 
.I ?
key displays the full list of keyboard shortcuts.
