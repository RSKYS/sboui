- gnucash picking up wrong build options (not sure if reproducible)
- Make blacklist also apply to install
- When using -f to specify config file and then changing options in the UI, it
  overwrites the default config file instead of the specified one. Fix that.
- Segfault when using my custom repository with -f /etc/sboui/sboui-custom.conf.  Seems to be caused by buildopts (moving the existing files out fixes it).
- Option / question to allow build to proceed when MD5sum fails
- Option in sboui-backend to not remove source tarball
