Things for 1.0
================================================================================
* Show a message after syncing instead of pausing, once sbopkg and sbotools are
  changed to give an error when sync fails.

Things for 0.3
================================================================================
* Add functionality to jump to a name in lists while typing.
* Smarter checks for whether changes were actually applied, and try multiple
  methods for upgrades and reinstalls if needed.
* Add "Show package info" action.

Completed for 0.3
================================================================================
* Add a package blacklist to prevent upgrading/reinstalling/removing packages
  installed from a different repo.
* Add a "Blacklisted" filter.
* Remove blacklisted packages from upgradable filter.
* Make a position notifier on the right side when scrolling in lists and input
  boxes.

Completed for 0.2.1
================================================================================
* Don't warn about skipping dependencies unless actually installing the
  requested package
* Actually close file in ShellReader::close() (had no noticeable effect in use)
* Check for and warn about invalid package names
* Check for and warn about missing .info files on startup, after sync, after
  install/upgrade/reinstall/remove, and when computing dependencies
* Better check for upgradable packages. Packages are now marked as upgradable
  whenever installed_version != available_version, except for when
  installed_version also has a trailing tag starting with by an underscore.
  (Kernel module SlackBuilds often do this.) Previously, anything added after
  the available_version text would be considered a tag, which could result in
  packages not being labeled upgradable when they actually should be.
* Restore original selection after pressing Esc in ComboBoxes.
