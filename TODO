Things to do before version 1.0
================================================================================
* More efficient internal search through sorted lists (currently use naive 
  search)
* Get rid of sboutil.sh shell script, which currently reads *.info files and
  checks if a package is installed. (Do it all in C++ instead.)
* Make a position notifier on the right side when scrolling in lists and input
  boxes.
* Add functionality to jump to a name in lists while typing.
* Use environment variable to get default editor.
* Make sure reinstalling works with sbotools once this functionality makes it
  into an official sbotools release (it is in the latest git). May require
  addition of a reinstall_cmd or similar.
