- gnucash picking up wrong build options (not sure if reproducible)
- Make blacklist also apply to install
- Segfault when using my custom repository with -f /etc/sboui/sboui-custom.conf.  Seems to be caused by buildopts (moving the existing files out fixes it).
- Check default repository directory for sbopkg
