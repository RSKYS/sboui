- Add sub-action to list inverse deps
- Ability to add custom notes for each SlackBuild
- sboui-update-notifier keeps running after logout (I'm not sure why), so add
  something to check if there is already a running process (use psutil) and
  bail out if so. That way we don't get duplicates.
- Fixed behavior of sboinstall --reinstall -r (https://github.com/pink-mist/sbotools/issues/72)
- gnucash picking up wrong build options
