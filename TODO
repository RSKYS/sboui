Things for 1.0
================================================================================
* Add a package blacklist to prevent upgrading/reinstalling/removing packages
  installed from a different repo.
* Make a position notifier on the right side when scrolling in lists and input
  boxes.
* Add functionality to jump to a name in lists while typing.

Things for 0.2
================================================================================
* Add a "Cancel All" option for InstallBox when applying tags.
* Don't re-read entire repo after applying changes, only update installed
  status and related info.
* Make tagged entries and hotkeys stand out when color is disabled.
* Do reinstalls by removing and then installing again. (Otherwise, it doesn't
  work with sbotools.)
* Submit to SlackBuilds.org.

Completed since 0.1.1
================================================================================
* Show installed packages that appear in the repo but do not have the SBo tag.
* Display a warning and option to edit when upgrading/reinstalling/removing
  a package from a different repo.
* Get rid of sboutil.sh shell script, which previously read *.info files and
  and checked if a package is installed. (Do it all in C++ instead.)
* More efficient internal search through sorted lists (previously used naive
  search).
* Replace inefficient bubble sort with sort function from C++ standard library.
* Add 'commander' example color theme.
* Add built-in color themes and ability to change them from options window.
* Display a message after successfully applying settings.
* Render pipes in info strings as vertical lines.
* Only pause and ask the user to press Enter when applying changes or syncing
  if there is an error. Otherwise, just show a message box when it is complete.
