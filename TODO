Things for 1.0
================================================================================
* Show a message after syncing instead of pausing, once sbopkg and sbotools are
  changed to give an error when sync fails.
* Make a PDF manual explaining UI usage.

Things for 0.3
================================================================================
* Instead of the rebuild function, recheck status for SlackBuilds in the build
  order after the action is complete. Then re-display the build actions box.
  This also would remove the need to have a "recheck" option for the InstallBox.
* Add a build options parameter for BuildListItems, which can be modified in the
  actions window. This would be a more natural way to handle build options than
  using the global environment variables.

Completed for 0.3
================================================================================
* Add a package blacklist to prevent upgrading/reinstalling/removing packages
  installed from a different repo.
* Add a "Blacklisted" filter.
* Remove blacklisted packages from upgradable filter.
* Make a position notifier on the right side when scrolling in lists and input
  boxes.
* Add "quick search" function to jump in active list while typing.
* Add "Show package info" action.
* Add option to search in READMEs.
* Smarter checks for whether changes were actually applied, and try reinstall
  if upgrade fails without giving an error.
* Add a "view command line output" command.
