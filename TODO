Things for 1.0
================================================================================
* Add a package blacklist to prevent upgrading/reinstalling/removing packages
  installed from a different repo.
* Add a "Blacklisted" filter.
* Make a position notifier on the right side when scrolling in lists and input
  boxes.
* Add functionality to jump to a name in lists while typing.
* Show a message after syncing instead of pausing, once sbopkg and sbotools are
  changed to give an error when sync fails.
* Do reinstalls in a single command once sbotools supports it.
* Smarter checks for success or failure when installing/upgrading/reinstalling/
  removing.
* Error checking when reading repo: missing .info files, bad package names.

Completed
================================================================================
* Don't warn about skipping dependencies unless actually installing the
  requested package
