Things for 1.0
================================================================================
* Add a package blacklist to prevent upgrading/reinstalling/removing packages
  installed from a different repo.
* Make a position notifier on the right side when scrolling in lists and input
  boxes.
* Add functionality to jump to a name in lists while typing.
* Make sure reinstalling works with sbotools once this functionality makes it
  into an official sbotools release (it is in the latest git). May require
  addition of a reinstall_cmd or similar.

Things for 0.2
================================================================================
* Display a warning when upgrading or reinstalling a package from a different
  repo.
* Add a "Cancel All" option for InstallBox when applying tags.
* Instead of pausing after applying changes, show a box listing the number of
  things installed/upgraded/reinstalled/removed. Also, don't pause after
  syncing, just show a message box for success or failure.
* Make tagged entries and hotkeys stand out when color is disabled.
* Make dividers in info strings look nicer.
* Submit to SlackBuilds.org.

Completed since 0.1.1
================================================================================
* Show installed packages that appear in the repo but do not have the SBo tag.
* Get rid of sboutil.sh shell script, which previously read *.info files and
  and checked if a package is installed. (Do it all in C++ instead.)
* More efficient internal search through sorted lists (previously used naive
  search).
* Replace inefficient bubble sort with sort function from C++ standard library.
* Add mc-like example color theme.
