- gnucash picking up wrong build options (not sure if reproducible)
- Segfault when using my custom repository with -f /etc/sboui/sboui-custom.conf.  Seems to be caused by buildopts (moving the existing files out fixes it).
- Action to clean /tmp/SBo
- Build options not removed properly in sub-actions dialog
- Make search operate on entire repository by default, but add option in search window to only operate on current list instead
