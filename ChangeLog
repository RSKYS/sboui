        version 0.5.1
        * Mark inverse deps for upgrade instead of reinstall as appropriate when
          rebuild_inv_deps = true

2017-10-30   Daniel Prosser <dpross1100@msn.com>

        version 0.5
        * Add option to rebuild inverse deps when upgrading a package
        * Fix upgrade check logic for WireGuard
        * Change color_theme='default' setting to 'default (dark)' in sboui.conf

2017-07-14   Daniel Prosser <dpross1100@msn.com>

        version 0.4.2
        * Color themes are now read automatically from /usr/share/sboui/themes
          and ~/.local/share/sboui/themes. The color_theme_file input has been
          removed.
        * Color themes now require one additional variable: theme_name
        * Build options are now entered one per line in the build options dialog
          box.
        * UX improvement: don't display whitespace at the end of a text input
          box unless it is needed for the cursor.
        * Bug fix: show information for correct SlackBuild in the status bar
          after tagging.

        version 0.4.1
        * Update ChangeLog and TODO, which were overlooked in 0.4

2017-06-08   Daniel Prosser <dpross1100@msn.com>

        * Allow browsing files in subdirectories
        * Ability to view README, browse files, set build options, and show
          package info for dependencies in InstallBox and BuildOrderBox 
        * Improve upgrade algorithm (use strict != criterion, but override this
          logic for SlackBuilds that append a tag to the version name)
        * Show an error message after syncing if the sync_cmd returns non-zero
        * Put information about dependency (libconfig) in README.md

2017-05-11   Daniel Prosser <dpross1100@msn.com>

2017-04-30   Daniel Prosser <dpross1100@msn.com>

          packages installed from a different repo
        * Add a "Blacklisted" filter
        * Remove blacklisted packages from upgradable filter
        * Make a position notifier on the right side when scrolling in lists
          and input boxes
        * Add "quick search" function to jump in active list while typing
        * Add build options parameter applying to each SlackBuild; set by
          selecting appropriate choice in actions dialog (previously, needed to
          use global install_vars and upgrade_vars for build options)
        * Add option to search in READMEs
        * Add "Show package info" action
        * Smarter checks for whether changes were actually applied, and try
          reinstall if upgrade fails without giving an error
        * Add a "view command line output" command
        * Re-display actions dialog after install/upgrade/reinstall/reinstall

        * Various bug fixes and UX improvements

2017-04-17   Daniel Prosser <dpross1100@msn.com>

        version 0.2.1
        * Don't warn about skipping dependencies unless actually installing the
          package
        * Actually close .info file in ShellReader::close() (had no noticeable
          effect in use)
        * Check for and warn about invalid installed package names (previously
          would segfault) 
        * Check for and warn about missing .info files when encountered
        * Better check for upgradable pacakges. A package is considered
          upgradable if installed_version != upgradable_version, except when
          the only difference is a trailing tag starting with an underscore in
          installed_version (some packages for kernel modules are like this). 
          Previously, anything after the available_version text was considered
          a tag, even if it didn't begin with an underscore.
        * Restore original selection after pressing Esc in ComboBoxes.

        * More efficient internal sorting algorithm
        * Add color pair for (tagged, bg_popup) -- was missing previously
        * Fix a bug in CMake module that checks for libconfig++
        * Add "commander" color theme
        * Render pipes in info displays as vertical lines
        * Allow message boxes to handle newlines
        * Improve sizing logic for message boxes
        * Add information message boxes (not just errors and warnings)
        * Warn about changing packages installed from different repository
        * Change "Help" to "Keys" in main window info

        * Reinstall by removing then installing again (needed for sbotools)
        * Add skip / cancel options when applying tags
        * Make tagged items and hotkeys visible when color is disabled
        * Always pause after syncing instead of showing a message box
          (because sbopkg and sbotools don't exit with error on sync failure)
        * Give a more useful error message when reading repo fails
        * Add standard repo_dir location for sbotools as comment in sboui.conf
        * Don't re-read the entire repository after install, upgrade, etc.
